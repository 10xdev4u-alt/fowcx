## 2. Personal Communication Systems (PCS)

Personal Communication Systems (PCS) represent a broad concept encompassing various wireless communication technologies designed to provide ubiquitous and personalized communication services. The term PCS emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s, envisioning a future where individuals could communicate anytime, anywhere, using a single, portable device.

### 2.1. Core Objectives of PCS

The primary goals of PCS are often summarized by three key concepts:

1.  **Personal Mobility:** The ability of a user to access telecommunication services at any terminal on the basis of a personal identifier, regardless of the location of that terminal. This implies that the network knows the user's current location.
2.  **Terminal Mobility:** The ability of a terminal to access telecommunication services from different locations while in motion, maintaining an active connection. This is the traditional cellular concept of handoff.
3.  **Service Portability:** The ability of a user to access the same set of services, with the same quality, regardless of the network access point or terminal used.

### 2.2. Key Characteristics of PCS

*   **Ubiquitous Coverage:** Aims to provide seamless communication across diverse geographical areas.
*   **Personalized Services:** Services are tailored to the individual user, often linked to a personal identification number rather than a specific device.
*   **Microcellular/Picocellular Architecture:** To achieve higher capacity and better coverage in dense urban areas, PCS often utilizes smaller cell sizes compared to traditional cellular systems.
*   **Integration of Services:** Envisions the integration of various communication services, including voice, data, and messaging, into a single platform.
*   **Low-Power, Lightweight Terminals:** Designed for small, portable, and energy-efficient devices.
*   **Interoperability:** Aims for seamless operation across different network technologies and service providers.

### 2.3. Evolution and Impact

While PCS was initially conceived as a distinct set of technologies (e.g., early 1900MHz cellular bands in the US were often branded as PCS), its core objectives have largely been absorbed and realized by the evolution of cellular mobile communication systems (2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G). Modern cellular networks embody the principles of personal and terminal mobility, and increasingly, service portability.
