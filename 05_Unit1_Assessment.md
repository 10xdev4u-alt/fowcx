## 5. Answers

### 5.1. Quiz Questions - Answers

1.  **Answer:** c) 1G
    -   **Concept:** The first generation of cellular technology was based on analog radio signals for voice communication, lacking the digital capabilities of later generations.
    -   **Reasoning:** 1G systems, such as AMPS, used Frequency Modulation (FM) for voice calls, which is an analog method. Digital technology was introduced with 2G.

2.  **Answer:** b) SMS (Short Message Service)
    -   **Concept:** 2G's digital nature enabled the transmission of small packets of text data alongside voice traffic, creating a new form of communication.
    -   **Reasoning:** The shift to a digital network with GSM and CDMA standards allowed for the creation of data services, with SMS being the most prominent and widely adopted.

3.  **Answer:** c) 4G
    -   **Concept:** 4G LTE architecture is built on an all-IP core network, meaning all traffic, including voice, is handled as data packets.
    -   **Reasoning:** 4G introduced Voice over LTE (VoLTE), which eliminated the need for a separate circuit-switched domain for voice calls, unlike 2G and 3G.

4.  **Answer:** Mobility / Handoff Support.
    -   **Concept:** Cellular systems are designed for wide-area coverage with seamless call continuity, while cordless systems are for local, short-range use.
    -   **Reasoning:** Cellular systems support handoff, allowing a user to move between cells without dropping a call. Cordless systems do not support handoff and are limited to the range of a single base station.

5.  **Answer:** To transmit short, one-way messages (pages) to a mobile receiver.
    -   **Concept:** Paging is a wireless telecommunication service for broadcasting brief messages to subscribers.
    -   **Reasoning:** Its primary function is to alert a user with a numeric or alphanumeric message, relying on high-power simulcasting for excellent reliability and coverage.

6.  **Answer:** b) URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication)
    -   **Concept:** URLLC is a key service category of 5G focused on providing mission-critical connections with near-zero delay and extremely high dependability.
    -   **Reasoning:** This capability is essential for applications like autonomous vehicles or remote surgery where even a millisecond of delay can have critical consequences.

7.  **Answer:** Channel Request message.
    -   **Concept:** A Mobile Originated Call begins with the mobile station requesting a radio channel from the network to initiate signaling.
    -   **Reasoning:** The MS sends this request on a common control channel (the Random Access Channel, RACH) to get the attention of the base station and be allocated a dedicated channel for call setup.

8.  **Answer:** To provide the location of the called mobile subscriber.
    -   **Concept:** The HLR is the network's master database that tracks which VLR (and associated MSC) a mobile subscriber is currently visiting.
    -   **Reasoning:** In an MTC, the network must first query the HLR to find out where to route the call before it can page the mobile in its current location.

9.  **Answer:** The ability of a user to access services at any terminal based on a personal identifier.
    -   **Concept:** Personal mobility decouples the user's identity from a specific device or location, making the service personal to the user.
    -   **Reasoning:** This means the network can find and deliver services to you, regardless of what phone or terminal you are using, as long as you are properly identified.

10. **Answer:** c) TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)
    -   **Concept:** TDMA is a channel access method that allows several users to share the same frequency channel by dividing the signal into different time slots.
    -   **Reasoning:** The GSM standard, which is the foundation of most 2G networks, explicitly uses a combination of FDMA and TDMA to partition its available spectrum.

### 5.2. Reasoning Questions - Answers

1.  **Answer:** 1G's use of analog signals vs. 2G's digital encryption.
    -   **Concept:** Analog signals are inherently insecure, while digital signals can be mathematically encrypted to ensure privacy.
    -   **Reasoning:** 1G systems transmitted voice as an unencrypted analog (FM) wave, which could be easily intercepted. 2G digitized the voice into bits, allowing for the application of encryption algorithms that scrambled the data, making it unintelligible to eavesdroppers.

2.  **Answer:** By reusing the same frequencies in non-adjacent cells.
    -   **Concept:** Frequency reuse is a core cellular principle where the same set of frequencies is reused in a planned pattern of cells that are geographically separated.
    -   **Reasoning:** This separation ensures that co-channel interference is kept below a tolerable threshold. This technique allows a limited spectrum to be reused many times over a large service area, dramatically increasing the overall system capacity.

3.  **Answer:** Redundancy due to cellular phones and niche use due to reliability.
    -   **Concept:** Paging is a one-way, highly reliable broadcast system, while cellular is a two-way, feature-rich point-to-point system.
    -   **Reasoning:** Paging declined because cellular phones offered two-way voice and SMS, making pagers obsolete for the general public. They persist in niche applications like hospitals due to superior signal penetration in complex buildings and extreme reliability for critical alerts.

4.  **Answer:** The shift from a voice-centric to a data-centric network model.
    -   **Concept:** 3G was designed from the ground up to support high-speed packet data, enabling a true mobile internet experience.
    -   **Reasoning:** While 2G had slow, "bolted-on" data services, 3G's higher data rates (Mbps vs. kbps) and "always-on" packet-switched architecture made services like video calling, web browsing, and music streaming practical for the first time on mobile.

5.  **Answer:** Voice is treated as data packets (VoLTE) over an IP network.
    -   **Concept:** An "all-IP network" uses the Internet Protocol for all communications, unifying the transport layer for both voice and data.
    -   **Reasoning:** In 4G, this is realized as Voice over LTE (VoLTE). This eliminates the need for a separate circuit-switched domain for voice, leading to more efficient spectrum use, faster call setup, and higher quality (HD) voice calls.

6.  **Answer:** The mechanism is Handoff (or Handover).
    -   **Concept:** Handoff is the process of transferring an active call or data session from one cell to another without service interruption.
    -   **Reasoning:** As the mobile station moves away from its serving base station, the network detects the weakening signal and instructs the MS to switch to a new, stronger base station, seamlessly re-routing the call via the MSC.

7.  **Answer:** By targeting three distinct service categories: eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC.
    -   **Concept:** 5G is not a monolithic upgrade but a platform designed to serve diverse use cases beyond human-centric communication.
    -   **Reasoning:** eMBB serves the consumer need for faster speeds (streaming, VR). URLLC serves industrial/critical needs for reliability and low latency (robotics, autonomous cars). mMTC serves the IoT market by enabling massive numbers of low-power devices (sensors).

8.  **Answer:** Local mobility vs. wide-area mobility.
    -   **Concept:** Cordless systems are private, short-range extensions of a wired line, while cellular systems are public, wide-area networks.
    -   **Reasoning:** Cordless systems offer only local mobility around a single base station and do not support handoff. Cellular systems provide wide-area mobility by using a network of interconnected cells and supporting seamless handoff between them.

9.  **Answer:** To find the subscriber's current location before attempting to contact them.
    -   **Concept:** The HLR is the central repository of subscriber location information, while paging is a localized broadcast action.
    -   **Reasoning:** The network must first determine the subscriber's current serving MSC by querying the HLR. Routing the call to that specific MSC and *then* paging only within that MSC's location area is vastly more efficient than broadcasting a page across the entire national network.

10. **Answer:** By decoupling the user's identity from the physical device.
    -   **Concept:** The SIM card is a secure integrated circuit that stores the subscriber's unique network identity (IMSI) and authentication keys.
    -   **Reasoning:** This allows a user to move their subscription and personal phone number between different GSM devices simply by transferring the SIM card. This makes the service personal to the user, not tied to the hardware, which is a cornerstone of personal mobility.

### 5.3. Real-World Happening Questions - Answers

1.  **Answer:** Superior reliability and simplicity/battery life.
    -   **Concept:** Paging networks are designed for mission-critical broadcast, while smartphones are complex, general-purpose devices.
    -   **Reasoning:** Paging networks offer exceptional signal penetration in dense buildings like hospitals. Furthermore, pagers are simple, durable devices with multi-week battery life, ensuring they are always operational to receive a critical alert.

2.  **Answer:** Inability to stream due to insufficient data rates.
    -   **Concept:** 2G networks provide data speeds measured in kilobits per second (kbps), while HD video requires megabits per second (Mbps).
    -   **Reasoning:** The data rate of a 2G connection is orders of magnitude too slow to support the bandwidth demands of HD video streaming. The attempt would result in constant, unwatchable buffering or complete failure to load.

3.  **Answer:** mMTC (Massive Machine-Type Communications).
    -   **Concept:** mMTC is a 5G capability designed to support a very high density of low-power, low-throughput IoT devices.
    -   **Reasoning:** A smart city's streetlights represent a massive number of devices that only need to send small amounts of data infrequently (e.g., status, on/off commands). mMTC is optimized for this exact scenario of connecting millions of devices per square kilometer.

4.  **Answer:** Due to Circuit-Switched Fallback (CSFB).
    -   **Concept:** Early 4G LTE networks were often "data-only," lacking a native mechanism for handling traditional voice calls.
    -   **Reasoning:** When a voice call was initiated, the 4G network would "fall back" to an available 2G or 3G network, which had the necessary circuit-switched infrastructure to handle the call. The introduction of VoLTE on 4G networks later made this unnecessary.

5.  **Answer:** Yes, a modern industrial cordless system would be suitable.
    -   **Concept:** Modern cordless standards like DECT are not limited to single-base home use and can create private, multi-cell networks.
    -   **Reasoning:** An industrial DECT system can provide coverage over a large factory floor with multiple base stations, supporting seamless handoff between them. This creates a private, reliable, and cost-effective voice network without relying on public cellular service.

6.  **Answer:** Through the process of international roaming.
    -   **Concept:** Roaming allows a subscriber of one network (the home network) to use the facilities of another network (the visited network).
    -   **Reasoning:** The visited network's VLR communicates with the user's HLR in their home country. When a call arrives, the HLR provides the necessary routing information to forward the call to the MSC in the visited network where the user is currently located.

7.  **Answer:** Autonomous vehicles communicating with each other (V2V).
    -   **Concept:** URLLC provides near-instantaneous, highly dependable communication links for mission-critical applications.
    -   **Reasoning:** For autonomous cars to safely coordinate movements, such as emergency braking or navigating intersections, they must exchange data with near-zero latency. A delay of even a few milliseconds could be the difference between avoiding a collision and causing one.

8.  **Answer:** Technological incompatibility and network decommissioning.
    -   **Concept:** 1G technology is analog, while all modern cellular networks (2G through 5G) are digital.
    -   **Reasoning:** A 1G analog phone cannot communicate with a digital network. Furthermore, all public 1G network infrastructure has been decommissioned and replaced by newer digital technologies.

9.  **Answer:** 4G (LTE) is the minimum requirement.
    -   **Concept:** Augmented Reality (AR) requires both high bandwidth to download complex visual data and low latency to sync that data with the real world in real-time.
    -   **Reasoning:** 4G LTE provides the multi-megabit speeds and lower latency necessary for a smooth AR experience. 3G's lower speeds and higher latency would result in slow-loading assets and a noticeable lag between user movement and the AR display.

10. **Answer:** Through the combination of a SIM/eSIM and cloud-based user accounts.
    -   **Concept:** Personal mobility is achieved by separating the user's identity from the physical hardware.
    -   **Reasoning:** The SIM (or eSIM) provides the core network identity, allowing the phone number and service plan to move between devices. Cloud accounts (like Apple ID or Google Account) then provide service portability, syncing apps, contacts, and settings, creating a seamless personal experience across hardware.
